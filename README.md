Feel free to modify this script as much as you want, use it to your hearts desire, fork it, etc. That's the purpose of open source!

You ABSOLUTELY do NOT need to donate. I'm just a university student trying to learn how to code and make programs and scripts. If you decide to donate and support me and this project, thank you! I appreciate your support!

If you are feeling kind enough to donate to me here is my bitcoin address.
